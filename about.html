                    <h1>About Rob</h1>
                    <p>I've always been drawn to the intersection of technology and human behavior. Growing up with a lifelong fascination for how things work—both technically and psychologically—I found UX design as the perfect bridge between visual creativity and understanding people. It's where curiosity meets purpose.</p>
                    
                    <p>What excites me most about UX is the depth of knowledge you gain across different sectors. Every project is an opportunity to become a domain expert, collaborate with specialists, and understand the unique challenges that drive industries forward. I've been fortunate to work with genuinely thoughtful people who approach problems strategically, and that collaborative environment makes all the difference in how I approach my work.</p>
                    
                    <p>My design philosophy centers on one core principle: understand what a system is actually trying to accomplish and what users are genuinely capable of doing—then design the best bridge between those two things. Convention exists for a reason, but it's a proven method, not a blueprint. The best solutions often come from understanding the underlying operations deeply enough to know when to challenge them.</p>
                    
                    <p>Outside of design, you'll find me at the gym, playing video games with friends, getting lost in a good film, or working through whatever book has captured my attention. I believe how you spend your time outside work matters—it shapes how you think and create.</p>
